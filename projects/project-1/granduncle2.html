<center><p>this is the granduncle i see the least. he lives by himself, but visits his son jay a lot. </p>
    <p>recently, his wife, my grandma's sister, passed away. it caused huge waves throughout our family and gathered everyone for a funeral. i wasn't able to attend, but it was the main event that spurred aunt bin to arrange a family reunion. </p>
    <p>my aunt likes to talk to him through the security cameras in his house. she checks up on him often.</p></center>
