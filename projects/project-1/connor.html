<center><p>connor just recently reached the age that i can interact with him and actually understand what he's saying. </p>
    <p>he's very mild, which is surprising, considering his mother and sister, but likes to play minecraft and other videogames. </p>
    <p>he was very helpful when making the cake with his older sister, which was reassuring. </p></center>
