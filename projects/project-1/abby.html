<center><p>abby grew up in massachusetts, was really good friends with andrew. </p>
    <p>she moved away to california for college, so i dont see her often. she visits boston to see her mom, so i see her once every few months.</p>
    <p>i think she's arguably the most well adjusted and kindest out of all of my cousins.</p></center>
