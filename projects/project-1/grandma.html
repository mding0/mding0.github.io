<center><p>my grandma is very caring and a little terrifying. she just turned eighty-eight and insists on driving everywhere herself.  </p>
    <p>she and my mother tend to have insane blowout arguments in the kitchen. regardless, she's a cornerstone of the family, as a part of the 'original' generation.</p>
    <p>she likes to give me and my sister food. her memory has been failing her recently, which is concerning.</p></center>
