<center><p>james is the only asian-american in our parents generation. he went to highschool in america, thus has the best english out of everyone. </p>
    <p>he's the youngest in my parents generation and is also the most mischevious. during our family reunion, he got my dad and multiple other people drunk. he would also noticeably not help with cooking or any other daily tasks.</p>
    <p>he is quite athletic and enjoys cycling and a slew of other sports. he met his wife on a deepsea fishing trip.</p></center>
