<center><p>caitlyn is my first cousin, so i'm closer to her than the rest. she also lives in the same neighborhood as me. </p>
    <p>she's in florida at ringling right now, studying animation. i think she's doing alright, but she doesn't handle stress well at all. i hope she's doing okay in college. </p>
    <p>i made a cake with her during our family reunion. i thought i would go crazy in the process. she has recently started collecting and wearing eclectic clothes.</p></center>
