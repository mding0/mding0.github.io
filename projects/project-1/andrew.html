<center><p>andrew went to lexington high. i found out he also dated one of my roomate's friends.</p>
    <p>he used to work at wegeman's and shuck oysters, and play in a jazz band, and some other things i forgot. right now he's doing his masters degree in Baltimore.</p>
    <p>he did his undergraduate in rochester, NY in biochemistry or bioengineering. he likes to work out and make fun of abby. </p>
    <p>i think he's funny and he's the oldest male cousin, so he tries to be grounded for the sake of the rest of us.</p></center>
