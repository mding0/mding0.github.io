<center><p>i don't see my granduncle that often because he lives in california. he's the oldest out the 'original' generation. </p>
    <p>His english is astoundingly good. he moved to america at some point, and was a professor of engineering. </p>
    <p>at the family reunion, he quizzed all of my cousins (all of whom are in STEM) to solve some math problems his students came up with. i think only a few people got the answer.</p></center>
