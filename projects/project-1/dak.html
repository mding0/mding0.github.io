<center><p>i see dak quite often, since i visit sarah's house more or less every month. he's reliable, but reserved and introverted.</p>
    <p>i found out he listens to a lot of k-pop -- particularly girl groups/the mature, female singers. he randomly played some songs in the car and I thought I was going insane.</p>
