<center><p>ariel is super athletic, but most of all she likes swimming. she's taller than the rest of the female cousins and she's 13. </p>
    <p>she lives in california and is very good friends with hannah. she likes to toss around her baby sister.</p>
    <p>i don't see much of her, ever. I've met her around three times so far and she's been very different each time.</p></center>
