<center><p>my grandpa passed away when I was a sophmore in highschool. it was my first close death in the family, and it was very strange processing it. </p>
    <p>he died of pulminary fibrosis, apparently from when he smoked as a young adult. my dad told me he was very paranoid about his health, especially smoking, but it seemed the damage was already done. </p>
    <p>i don't remember a lot about my grandpa, but he was always sitting at the kitchen table.</p></center>
