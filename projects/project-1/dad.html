<center><p>my dad and mom got married in china, immigrated to america, and had me and my sister. i love my dad very much.  </p>
    <p>he and i are the fly on the wall during family gatherings. he has provided me with inumerable insane family drama stories. he also has the tendency to exaggerate, so i don't know whether i should believe him or not. </p>
    <p>i also learned from him that in-laws will never go away. i suppose he's in it for the long run.</p></center>
