<center><p>aunt binbin is the oldest out of my parents generation. she makes the plans, she holds the family together.  </p>
    <p>right now, she lives in boston by herself. both of her daughters have moved out to the other side of the family. </p>
    <p>my dad told me some crazy stories about her. i don't know whether to believe him or not, but she does seem a little deranged when she's stressed. </p></center>
