<center><p>my sister is currently in med school at Tufts. i see her sometimes when i go to boston.  </p>
    <p>growing up, we were quite mean to each other, but things are fine now and we are civil, if not supportive. </p>
    <p>she's very stressed about med school right now but she's finished her step one, and is on vacation with her friend.</p></center>
