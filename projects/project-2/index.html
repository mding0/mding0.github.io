        <h1>RED</h1>
        <p>Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite
            violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.[1] It is a primary color in the
            RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the
            complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to
            bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.[2]
        </p>

        <p> Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and
            Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate
            victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the
            gates and walls of palaces. In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and
            wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first
            synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red became a symbolic color of communism and
            socialism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The Soviet red
            banner would subsequently be used throughout the entire history of the Soviet Union, starting from 1922 and
            ending with its 1991 dissolution. China adopted its own red flag following the Chinese Communist Revolution.
            A red flag was also adopted by North Vietnam in 1954, and by all of Vietnam in 1975.
        </p>

        <p>Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage.
            Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with
            heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. In China, India, and many other Asian countries it
            is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sectionone">Shades and Variations</h2>
        <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
        <p> Varieties of the color red may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation, intensity, or colorfulness),
            or
            lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or three of these qualities. Variations in value are
            also
            called tints and shades, a tint being a red or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black.
            Four
            examples are shown below.</p>

        <h3 id="sectionthree">Seeing red</h3>
<p>
    
            The human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between approximately 625 and 740 nanometers.[1]
            It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the light just past this range is called infrared, or below
            red, and cannot be seen by human eyes, although it can be sensed as heat.[7] In the language of optics, red is
            the color evoked by light that stimulates neither the S or the M (short and medium wavelength) cone cells of the
            retina, combined with a fading stimulation of the L (long-wavelength) cone cells.[8]
</p>
<p>
        Primates can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans, but many kinds of
        mammals, such as dogs and cattle, have dichromacy, which means they can see blues and yellows, but cannot
        distinguish red and green (both are seen as gray). Bulls, for instance, cannot see the red color of the cape of
        a bullfighter, but they are agitated by its movement.[9] (See color vision).
</p>
        <p>One theory for why primates developed sensitivity to red is that it allowed ripe fruit to be distinguished from
        unripe fruit and inedible vegetation.[10] This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage
        of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces.[11]</p>

       <p> Red light is used to help adapt night vision in low-light or night time, as the rod cells in the human eye are
        not sensitive to red.[12][13]</p>

        <h3 id="sectionfour">In color theory and on a computer screen</h3>

       <p> In the RYB color model, which is the basis of traditional color theory, red is one of the three primary colors,
        along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet: Cennino Cennini, in
        his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, "If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac (red
        lake), ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder"; he noted that it could also
        be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite.[14]</p>

        <p>In the CMY and CMYK color models, red is a secondary color subtractively mixed from magenta and yellow.</p>

        <p>In the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors. Red, green and blue light combined
        makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color.
        This principle is used to generate colors on such as computer monitors and televisions. For example, magenta on
        a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make
        violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at
        equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater
        amount of blue light and less red light.[15]</p>

        <h3 id="sectionfive">Color of sunset</h3>

        <p>Sunsets and sunrises are often red because of an optical effect called Rayleigh scattering.</p>
        <p>As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some of the colors are scattered out of
        the beam by air molecules and airborne particles due to Rayleigh scattering, changing the final color of the
        beam that is seen. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are
        removed from the light that finally reaches the eye. At sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight
        through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely,
        leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by
        cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow.</p>

        <h3 id="sectionsix">Lasers</h3>
        <p>
            Lasers emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the ruby laser in
            1960. In 1962 the red helium–neon laser was invented, and these two types of lasers were widely used in many
            scientific applications including holography, and in education. Red helium–neon lasers were used commercially in
            LaserDisc players. The use of red laser diodes became widespread with the commercial success of modern DVD
            players, which use a 660 nm laser diode technology. Today, red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available
            to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive laser pointers. Portable, high-powered versions are also
            available for various applications.[19] More recently, 671 nm diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers have been
            introduced to the market for all-DPSS laser display systems, particle image velocimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and
            holography.
        </p>

        <p>
            Red's wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies; red lasers, used in early compact disc
            technologies, are being replaced by blue lasers, as red's longer wavelength causes the laser's recordings to
            take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings.
        </p>

        <h3 id="sectionseven">Astronomy</h3>
        <p>
            Mars is called the Red Planet because of the reddish color imparted to its surface by the abundant iron oxide
            present there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Astronomical objects that are moving away from the observer exhibit a Doppler red shift.
            Jupiter's surface displays a Great Red Spot caused by an oval-shaped mega storm south of the planet's
            equator.[23]
        </p>
        <p>
            Red giants are stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and switched to thermonuclear
            fusion of hydrogen in a shell that surrounds its core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than
            that of the Sun. However, their outer envelope is much lower in temperature, giving them an orange hue. Despite
            the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun due to their
            large size.
        </p>
        <p>
            Red supergiants like Betelgeuse, Antares, Mu Cephei, VV Cephei, and VY Canis Majoris one of the biggest stars in
            the Universe, are the biggest variety of red giants. They are huge in size, with radii 200 to 1700 times greater
            than the Sun, but relatively cool in temperature (3000–4500 K), causing their distinct red tint. Because they
            are shrinking rapidly in size, they are surrounded by an envelope or skin much bigger than the star itself. The
            envelope of Betelgeuse is 250 times bigger than the star inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            A red dwarf is a small and relatively cool star, which has a mass of less than half that of the Sun and a
            surface temperature of less than 4,000 K. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Galaxy, but
            due to their low luminosity, from Earth, none are visible to the naked eye.[24]
        </p>

        <h3 id="sectioneight">Pigments and dyes</h3>

        <h4>Food coloring</h4>
        <p>
            The most common synthetic food coloring today is Allura Red AC, a red azo dye that goes by several names
            including: Allura Red, Food Red 17, C.I. 16035, FD&C Red 40,[25][26] It was originally manufactured from coal
            tar, but now is mostly made from petroleum.[27]
        </p>
<p>
    
            In Europe, Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children. It is banned in Denmark, Belgium,
            France and Switzerland, and was also banned in Sweden until the country joined the European Union in 1994.[26]
            The European Union approves Allura Red AC as a food colorant, but EU countries' local laws banning food
            colorants are preserved.[28]
</p>

        <p>
            In the United States, Allura Red AC is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cosmetics,
            drugs, and food. It is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products, such as soft drinks, children's
            medications, and cotton candy. On June 30, 2010, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called for
            the FDA to ban Red 40.[29]
        </p>

        Because of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes, many companies have
        switched to using natural pigments such as carmine, made from crushing the tiny female cochineal insect. This
        insect, originating in Mexico and Central America, was used to make the brilliant scarlet dyes of the European
        Renaissance.[citation needed]

        <h4 id="sectionnine">Autumn leaves</h4>

        <p>
            The red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called anthocyanins. They are not present in the leaf
            throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer.[30] They develop in late
            summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of complex interactions of many
            influences—both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence
            of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced.[31]
        </p>

        <p>
            During the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the
            sugars manufactured by chlorophyll. But in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients,
            moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes,
            leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the
            production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are
            bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early
            spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries, red apples, blueberries,
            cherries, raspberries, and plums.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas—a famous
            example being New England—up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment.[30] In autumn forests they appear
            vivid in the maples, oaks, sourwood, sweetgums, dogwoods, tupelos, cherry trees and persimmons. These same
            pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical
            of many hardwood species. (See Autumn leaf color).
        </p>

        <h4 id="sectionten">Blood and other reds in nature</h4>
<p>
    
    
            Oxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated hemoglobin that contains iron molecules, with the iron
            components reflecting red light.[32][33] Red meat gets its color from the iron found in the myoglobin and
            hemoglobin in the muscles and residual blood.[34]
</p>

        <p>
            Plants like apples, strawberries, cherries, tomatoes, peppers, and pomegranates are often colored by forms of
            carotenoids, red pigments that also assist photosynthesis.[35]
        </p>


       
        <h3 id="sectioneleven">Hair color</h3>

        <p>Red hair only occurs in 1–2% of the human population.</p>
        <p>
            Red hair occurs naturally on approximately 1–2% of the human population.[36] It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in
            people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears in
            people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein.[37]
        </p>
<p>
    
            Red hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper. It is characterized by high levels
            of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels
            of the dark pigment eumelanin. The term "redhead" (originally redd hede) has been in use since at least
            1510.[38]
</p>

        <h3 id="sectiontwelve">In animal and human behavior</h3>
        <p>
            Red is associated with dominance in a number of animal species.[39] For example, in mandrills, red coloration of
            the face is greatest in alpha males, increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates, and directly
            correlated with levels of testosterone.[40] Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others, leading
            to significant differences in mortality, reproductive success and parental investment between individuals
            displaying red and those not.[41] In humans, wearing red has been linked with increased performance in
            competitions, including professional sport[42][43] and multiplayer video games.[44] Controlled tests have
            demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise, so the
            effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance.[45] Judges of tae kwon do have been
            shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue,[46] and, when asked, a significant majority of
            people say that red abstract shapes are more "dominant", "aggressive", and "likely to win a physical
            competition" than blue shapes.[39] In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance
            behavior, exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks[47] and elicits aversion in psychological
            tests where subjects are placed in an "achievement" context (e.g. taking an IQ test).[48]
